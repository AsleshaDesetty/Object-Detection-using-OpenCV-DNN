Object Detection using OpenCV DNN

Goal:
Developed object detection model using OpenCV Deep Neural Networks (DNN) module. 

Implementation: 
- Used OpenCV DNN layer API to build a convolutional neural network
- Added convolutional, pooling, dense layers for feature extraction  
- Trained model on dataset of images with object bounding boxes 
- Optimized model architecture for accuracy vs efficiency

Results: 
- Model can detect and localize multiple object classes
- Quantified model accuracy, inference time and efficiency
- Compared model metrics vs original TensorFlow/Caffe frameworks
- OpenCV DNN performed fastest on given dataset due to optimization 

Outcome:
- Built DNN-based object detector using OpenCV CNN APIs
- Evaluated model against other frameworks using custom dataset
- OpenCV DNN gave better optimized performance for this application
